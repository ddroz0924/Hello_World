I am an aspiring data analyst looking to learn and launch my career! My current project is working through the Google Professional Certificate in Data Analysis.

As a music teacher of 5 years, I was asked to constantly assess and analyze student performance in the split second as the music goes by. My work in education has helped me hone and appreciate my skills in analyzing patterns, organization, and communication. I seek opportunities to apply these skills analytical skills as well as to learn and improve the technical skills needed to launch a career in data analysis.

Classical music is still my hobby. I also enjoy board games and cooking. I grew up in Washington State, and currently live in the Tacoma area (south of Seattle). I would love to hear a reply from you! Especially if there are any fellow Trekkies, Settler's of Catan enthusiasts, or Jaime Oliver fans out there!
